# Webtech-Project-Hotel-Booking-System-
## Project Description
<p>There are many types of booking system is available in Bangladesh but so far no work has been done in the hotel booking system. 
So we think there are a lot of opportunity in this sector which help us for future life. Since the tourism sector increasing vastly day by day that’s 
why peoples are more connected with the hotel. By this system, the tourists can easily book a hotel and they will get free from annoyance situation.
It will solve unemployment problem and it will also develop our economy.</p>

<p>Now a days, people are so much interested to visit different kinds of attractive places. When they visit new places they have to stay at a hotel.
It is so much difficult to find out the nearest hotel. Hotel Booking System helps those people to book hotel easily before going a new place. By booking rooms 
they can easily enjoy their tour without any tension. Visitors don’t have to go hotel for booking room manually. This project will play those vital rules which is described.</p>
